# TitanicSurvivorPredictor

This Jupyter notebook contains the steps I went through to build some models using the kaggle Titanic dataset. The models predict whether
a passenger would survive the titanic. There are some EDA steps and preprocessing done on the data, which can be helpful as a guide in 
future projects
